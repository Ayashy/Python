### Explaination

In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organising data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Each data structure interacts with it's data in a different way and the approach each structure takes towards can be seen as respectively unique.

### Contents

Each folder here contains an implementation of a data structure, a `main.py` file which imports and uses the structure and a README.md which explains the organisation of each structure as well as the way it operates when manipulating it's contents. The README.md file also explains the usage of the method found in the data structure Python file.
